After cloning a repository:

1. Run 'npm install' from the dir containing package.json
2. Run 'bower install' from the dir containing bower.json
3. Run 'node server.js' from the dir containing index.html
4. Open a browser to the URL the node server is listening on.

For changes to webpack.config.js, step 4 will need to be repeated.
